# Audi Sales Analysis
## Project Overview
Audi is a premium automaker recognized for its performance and design. In this project, I analyzed a synthetic dataset of 50,000 vehicle transactions to identify top-performing models and dealerships over time.

Using SQL for data exploration and Tableau for visualization, I created an interactive dashboard that highlights key sales trends, profit margins, and dealership performance. The dashboard can support marketing and sales teams in making data-driven decisions about pricing, inventory, and promotional strategies.

## Objectives
* Identify the best-performing Audi vehicle models and dealerships over time.
* Uncover factors contributing to higher sales performance, such as profit margins and average monthly sale prices.
* Track consistent growth patterns in model sales using time-series analysis.
* Evaluate dealership trends to determine which locations are improving or declining in performance.
* Visualize findings in a clear, interactive dashboard for easy stakeholder consumption.

## Insights
### Sales
Only two vehicle models, the RS5 and Q6 e-tron, demonstrated consistent year-over-year growth in total sales revenue.
* RS5 saw an increase from $156M in 2022 to $172M in 2024, suggesting steady market demand for this performance-focused model.
* Q6 e-tron, part of Audi’s electric lineup, also experienced growth, rising from $40.2M to $41.9M, indicating a positive trend in consumer interest toward electric vehicles.

Audi’s vehicle pricing follows a clear pattern:
* High-end models such as the e-tron GT, RS5, and Q6 e-tron consistently maintained the highest average sale prices, often exceeding $100K.
* Mid-tier models like the Q5, Q7, and Q8 typically ranged between $60K and $90K, showing stable pricing across months and years.
* Entry-level models, including the A3 and A4, averaged below $65K, making them the most accessible options in the lineup.
### Dealerships
When comparing dealership revenues, the top three performers were:
1. Audi Lynbrook – $415.3M
2. Audi Staten Island – $415M
3. Audi Brooklyn – $414.7M

Several dealerships, including Audi Manhattan and Audi Lynbrook, rebounded with strong sales growth in the latest year after previous declines.
Others like Audi Bronx and Audi Brooklyn showed steady growth across all years, suggesting consistent market performance.
